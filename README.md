## Urban Inequality and Housing Market Analysis

This project applies Big Data techniques to analyze urban inequality and housing market dynamics. It builds a complete data pipeline — from raw open data to cleaned, formatted, and analyzed datasets — and produces dashboards to visualize socio-economic indicators at both neighborhood and district levels.

---

## Objectives
- Design an end-to-end Big Data pipeline using open data sources.  
- Process and integrate large datasets on income, cultural sites, and housing prices.  
- Apply distributed data processing, cleaning, and transformation techniques.  
- Compute key performance indicators related to affordability, inequality, and cultural accessibility.  
- Create analytical dashboards for data visualization and interpretation.

## Big Data Pipeline
The project follows a four-stage Big Data architecture:

1. Landing Zone – ingestion of raw CSV and JSON files.  
2. Formatting Zone – data standardization, cleaning, and normalization.  
3. Exploitation Zone – aggregation and computation of KPIs for analysis.  
4. Dashboarding – visualization of results through plots and interactive dashboards.
